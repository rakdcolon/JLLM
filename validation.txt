" Homarus gammarus , known as the European lobster or common lobster , is a species of <unk> lobster from the eastern Atlantic Ocean , Mediterranean Sea and parts of the Black Sea . It is closely related to the American lobster , H. americanus . It may grow to a length of 60 cm ( 24 in ) and a mass of 6 kilograms ( 13 lb ) , and bears a conspicuous pair of claws . In life , the lobsters are blue , only becoming "" lobster red "" on cooking . Mating occurs in the summer , producing eggs which are carried by the females for up to a year before hatching into <unk> larvae . Homarus gammarus is a highly esteemed food , and is widely caught using lobster pots , mostly around the British Isles .

" Homarus gammarus is a large <unk> , with a body length up to 60 centimetres ( 24 in ) and weighing up to 5 – 6 kilograms ( 11 – 13 lb ) , although the lobsters caught in lobster pots are usually 23 – 38 cm ( 9 – 15 in ) long and weigh 0 @.@ 7 – 2 @.@ 2 kg ( 1 @.@ 5 – 4 @.@ 9 lb ) . Like other crustaceans , lobsters have a hard <unk> which they must shed in order to grow , in a process called <unk> ( <unk> ) . This may occur several times a year for young lobsters , but decreases to once every 1 – 2 years for larger animals . 
"
" The first pair of <unk> is armed with a large , asymmetrical pair of claws . The larger one is the "" <unk> "" , and has rounded <unk> used for crushing prey ; the other is the "" cutter "" , which has sharp inner edges , and is used for holding or tearing the prey . Usually , the left claw is the <unk> , and the right is the cutter . 
"
" The <unk> is generally blue above , with spots that <unk> , and yellow below . The red colour associated with lobsters only appears after cooking . This occurs because , in life , the red pigment <unk> is bound to a protein complex , but the complex is broken up by the heat of cooking , releasing the red pigment . 
"
" The closest relative of H. gammarus is the American lobster , Homarus americanus . The two species are very similar , and can be crossed artificially , although hybrids are unlikely to occur in the wild since their ranges do not overlap . The two species can be distinguished by a number of characteristics : 
"
" The <unk> of H. americanus bears one or more spines on the underside , which are lacking in H. gammarus . 
"
" The spines on the claws of H. americanus are red or red @-@ tipped , while those of H. gammarus are white or white @-@ tipped . 
"
" The underside of the claw of H. americanus is orange or red , while that of H. gammarus is creamy white or very pale red .

" = = Life cycle = = 
"
""
" Female H. gammarus reach sexual maturity when they have grown to a carapace length of 80 – 85 millimetres ( 3 @.@ 1 – 3 @.@ 3 in ) , whereas males mature at a slightly smaller size . Mating typically occurs in summer between a recently <unk> female , whose shell is therefore soft , and a hard @-@ shelled male . The female carries the eggs for up to 12 months , depending on the temperature , attached to her <unk> . Females carrying eggs are said to be "" <unk> "" and can be found throughout the year . 
"
" The eggs hatch at night , and the larvae swim to the water surface where they drift with the ocean currents , preying on <unk> . This stage involves three <unk> and lasts for 15 – 35 days . After the third moult , the juvenile takes on a form closer to the adult , and adopts a <unk> lifestyle . The juveniles are rarely seen in the wild , and are poorly known , although they are known to be capable of digging extensive burrows . It is estimated that only 1 larva in every 20 @,@ 000 survives to the <unk> phase . When they reach a carapace length of 15 mm ( 0 @.@ 59 in ) , the juveniles leave their burrows and start their adult lives .

" Homarus gammarus is found across the north @-@ eastern Atlantic Ocean from northern Norway to the Azores and Morocco , not including the Baltic Sea . It is also present in most of the Mediterranean Sea , only missing from the section east of Crete , and along only the north @-@ west coast of the Black Sea . The <unk> populations are found in the Norwegian <unk> <unk> and <unk> , inside the Arctic Circle . 
"
" The species can be divided into four genetically distinct populations , one widespread population , and three which have diverged due to small effective population sizes , possibly due to adaptation to the local environment . The first of these is the population of lobsters from northern Norway , which have been referred to as the "" midnight @-@ sun lobster "" . The populations in the Mediterranean Sea are distinct from those in the Atlantic Ocean . The last distinct population is found in the Netherlands : samples from the <unk> were distinct from those collected in the North Sea or English Channel . 
"
" Attempts have been made to introduce H. gammarus to New Zealand , alongside other European species such as the edible crab , Cancer <unk> . Between 1904 and 1914 , one million lobster larvae were released from <unk> in <unk> , but the species did not become established there .

" Adult H. gammarus live on the continental shelf at depths of 0 – 150 metres ( 0 – <unk> ft ) , although not normally deeper than 50 m ( 160 ft ) . They prefer hard substrates , such as rocks or hard mud , and live in holes or crevices , emerging at night to feed . 
"
" The diet of H. gammarus mostly consists of other <unk> invertebrates . These include crabs , molluscs , sea <unk> , <unk> and polychaete worms . 
"
" The three <unk> lobster species Homarus gammarus , H. americanus and <unk> <unk> are hosts to the three known species of the animal <unk> <unk> ; the species on H. gammarus has not been described . 
"
" Homarus gammarus is susceptible to the disease <unk> , caused by the <unk> <unk> <unk> . Although it is frequently found in American lobsters , the disease has only been seen in captive H. gammarus , where prior occupation of the tanks by H. americanus could not be ruled out .

" Homarus gammarus is traditionally "" highly esteemed "" as a <unk> and was mentioned in "" The <unk> "" a seventeenth century English folk song . It may fetch very high prices and may be sold fresh , frozen , canned or powdered . Both the claws and the abdomen of H. gammarus contain "" excellent "" white meat , and most of the contents of the cephalothorax are edible . The exceptions are the <unk> mill and the "" sand vein "" ( gut ) . The price of H. gammarus is up to three times higher than that of H. americanus , and the European species is considered to have a better flavour . 
"
" <unk> are mostly fished using lobster pots , although lines <unk> with <unk> or <unk> sometimes succeed in tempting them out , to allow them to be caught in a net or by hand . In 2008 , 4 @,@ 386 t of H. gammarus were caught across Europe and North Africa , of which 3 @,@ 462 t ( 79 % ) was caught in the British Isles ( including the Channel Islands ) .

" Homarus gammarus was first given a binomial name by Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his Systema <unk> , published in 1758 . That name was Cancer gammarus , since Linnaeus ' concept of the genus Cancer at that time included all large crustaceans . 
"
" H. gammarus is the type species of the genus Homarus Weber , 1795 , as determined by Direction 51 of the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature . Prior to that direction , confusion arose because the species had been referred to by several different names , including <unk> <unk> <unk> , 1775 and Homarus vulgaris H. Milne @-@ Edwards , 1837 , and also because Friedrich Weber 's description of the genus had been overlooked until rediscovered by Mary <unk> , rendering any prior assignments of type species ( for Homarus H.

"
" There was much competition over the proposed name of the settlement . Ball and the more industrial residents of the city supported the name "" Meridian , "" believing the term to be synonymous with "" junction "" ; the more agrarian residents of the city preferred "" <unk> "" ( meaning "" mad river "" in a Native American language ) , from the name of a nearby creek ; and <unk> proposed "" <unk> City . "" Ball erected a station house on the Mobile and Ohio Railroad – the sign on which would alternate between "" Meridian "" and "" <unk> "" each day . Eventually the continued development of the railroads led to an influx of railroad workers who overruled the others in the city and left "" Meridian "" on the station permanently . The town was officially incorporated as Meridian on February 10 , 1860 . 
"
" Meridian was a small village at the start of the American Civil War in 1861 . Its strategic position at the railroad junction led to the Confederate construction of several military installations to support the war . During the Battle of Meridian in 1864 , General William <unk> Sherman led troops into the city , destroying the railroads in every direction , as well as an arsenal and immense <unk> ; his forces burned much of the buildings to the ground . Sherman is reported to have said afterwards , "" Meridian , with its depots , store @-@ houses , arsenal , hospitals , offices , hotels , and <unk> no longer exists . "" Despite the destruction , the railroad lines in the city were rapidly repaired , back in operation 26 working days after the battle . Race relations remained tense during the Reconstruction era , with the riot of 1871 following a fire that damaged many businesses . 
"
" The town <unk> in the aftermath of the Civil War , and experienced its "" Golden Age "" from 1880 to 1910 . The railroads in the area provided for a means of transportation and an influx of industries , which caused a population boom . As the population rose , commercial activity increased in the downtown area . Between 1890 and 1930 , Meridian was the largest city in Mississippi and a leading center for manufacturing in the South . Many of the city 's historic buildings were built during and just after this era , including the Grand Opera House in 1890 , the <unk> School in 1894 , two Carnegie libraries in 1913 , and the <unk> Building , Meridian 's tallest skyscraper , in 1929 . 
"
" The city continued to grow thanks to a commission government 's efforts to bring in 90 new industrial plants in 1913 and a booming automobile industry in the 1920s . Even through the stock market crash of 1929 and the following Great Depression , the city continued to attract new businesses . With <unk> becoming popular in the culture during the depth of the Depression , the S. H. Kress & Co. building , built to "" provide luxury to the common man , "" opened in downtown Meridian , as did the Temple Theater , which was used as a movie house . The federal <unk> was built in 1933 as a <unk> project . 
"
" After a brief <unk> of the economy at the end of the Depression , the country entered World War II , which renewed the importance of railroads . The rails were essential to transport gasoline and scrap metal to build military vehicles , so Meridian became the region 's rail center again . This renewed prosperity continued until the 1950s , when the automobile and Interstate Highway System became more popular than passenger rails . The decline of the railroad industry caused significant job losses , resulting in a population decline as workers left for other areas . 
"
" During the American Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s , Meridian was home to a Council of <unk> <unk> ( <unk> ) office and several other activist organizations . James <unk> and other local residents , along with Michael <unk> , his wife Rita , and Andrew Goodman , volunteers from the North , worked to create a community center , holding classes to help prepare African Americans in the area to regain the power to vote . Whites in the area resented the activism , and racial tension often resulted in violence . In June 1964 , <unk> , <unk> , and Goodman went to <unk> County , Mississippi , to meet with members of a black church that had been bombed and burned . The three disappeared that night on their way back to Meridian . Following a massive FBI investigation , their murdered bodies were found two months later , buried in an earthen dam .

" Starting in the 1960s and following the construction of highways that made <unk> easier , residents began to move away from downtown in favor of new housing subdivisions to the north . After strip commercial interests began to move downtown , the city worked to designate several areas as historic districts in the 1970s and 80s to preserve the architectural character of the city . The Meridian Historic <unk> and Landmarks Commission was created in 1979 , and the Meridian Main Street program was founded in 1985 .

Other projects included the renovation of the <unk> Building in 2001 and <unk> 's Restaurant in 2002 , as well as support for integrated urban design . Meridian Main Street , along with The Riley Foundation , helped renovate and adapt the historic Grand Opera House in 2006 for use as the "" Mississippi State University Riley Center for Education and the Performing Arts .

"
" After ownership of the Meridian Main Street was transferred to the Alliance for Downtown Meridian in late 2007 , the two organizations , along with the Meridian Downtown Association , spearheaded the downtown <unk> effort . The Alliance serves as an umbrella organization , allowing the other two organizations to use the its support staff and housing , and in turn the Alliance serves as a liaison between the organizations . Plans were underway to renovate the <unk> Building , but newly elected Mayor <unk> Barry killed the plans in early 2010 . Today , the Alliance helps to promote further development and restoration downtown ; its goal is to assist businesses such as specialty shops , restaurants , and bars because these help downtown become more active during the day and at night . The Meridian Downtown Association is primarily focused on increasing foot traffic downtown by organizing special events , and the Meridian Main Street program supports existing businesses downtown .

" Jeff Todd <unk> and several other writers have suggested that Lead <unk> had significant help with its authorship and claim it is not a genuine protest song .

" The High Five Interchange , north of downtown in Dallas , Texas , is a massive five @-@ level freeway interchange . It is the junction of two major highways carrying heavy rush hour traffic , the Lyndon B. Johnson Freeway ( Interstate 635 ) and the Central Expressway ( US 75 ) , and is the first five @-@ level stack interchange to be built in the city . 
"
" It replaces the <unk> three @-@ level , modified cloverleaf interchange built in the 1960s that caused a severe bottleneck by narrowing US 75 down to two lanes at the junction of the two highways . The looped ramps of the cloverleaf forced motorists to slow down drastically , backing up traffic . Left @-@ hand exits contributed to the congestion . Further , its two frontage roads were not directly connected to each other , making local access difficult . 
"
" <unk> to the celebratory gesture , the "" High Five "" name refers to the five flyover ramps handling the left @-@ turn movements that tower over the landscape . The interchange is as high as a 12 @-@ story building , and includes 43 bridges spread across five levels ( the "" High Five "" ) , 710 support tiers , and 60 miles of additional highway . The highest ramps are 120 feet ( 37 m ) above ground . The lanes of US 75 , which are on the bottom level , are 20 feet ( 6 m ) below ground level , giving the structure a total height of 140 feet from bottom to top As part of the project , I @-@ 635 was widened to include four dedicated high @-@ occupancy vehicle lanes ( <unk> lanes ) that are barrier @-@ separated and <unk> . 
"
" The roads on the five levels are : 
"
" Level I : US 75 , an eight lane highway , four lanes going each way 
"
" Level II : The junction of the two six @-@ lane frontage roads , each having three through lanes in each direction , left @-@ turn lanes and <unk> , and easy access to US 75 and I @-@ 635 
"
" Level III : I @-@ 635 , ten regular lanes , five going each way , and four <unk> lanes ( two going each way ) separated by barriers 
"
" Level IV and V : Direct connection ramps ( two levels ) , eliminating the left exits of the modified cloverleaf 
"
" The interchange , with its decorative <unk> on <unk> concrete elements , along with the visually appealing coloration specified by the Texas Department of Transportation ( <unk> ) , can be regarded as an enormous work of public art . The High Five also incorporates a hiking and bike trail , named the <unk> Trail , which runs under all levels of the interchange . The section of the trail passing beneath the interchange was constructed as part of the High Five project by <unk> . 
"
" The interchange is considered by Popular <unk> as one of "" The World 's 18 <unk> <unk> "" , calling it a "" labyrinth of lanes "" and a "" five @-@ level <unk> of engineering "" because of its height , the number of its bridges and other unusual design and construction features .

""
" The High Five Interchange project was planned as a replacement for the existing , <unk> interchange that accommodated 500 @,@ 000 vehicles daily and was located in one of the most intensely developed commercial zones in Dallas . It was a collaborative project between the <unk> , affected motorists and property owners , and the primary contractor , <unk> Construction . An essential consideration was to complete the project with as little disruption to the traffic flow as possible . 
"
" Reasons for upgrading the interchange , in addition to the need to increase traffic flow and reduce congestion , were to improve air quality , safety , and local access . 
"
" <unk> Construction Corporation submitted the lowest bid and was awarded the $ 261 million contract by <unk> , the largest ever by that agency . The construction contract for the High Five Interchange was unique in that it contained elements not found in other construction project contracts . For example , it specified the concrete maturity method to be used to ensure the concrete 's strength ( the first time <unk> had ever done so ) , and contained an early completion bonus , a <unk> scale of up to $ 11 million if the company completed the contract within four years . Also built into the construction contract was a provision that <unk> was charged for "" lane rentals "" by <unk> for time they closed down traffic lanes — fees based on <unk> assessments and the time of day the lane was closed . The fees ranged from $ 50 to a high of $ 110 @,@ 000 for rush hours . In order not to interfere with traffic flow during construction , the new interchange was designed largely as elevated flyover ramps and <unk> so they could be built high over the existing junction lanes ; once traffic was transferred to the new structures the old lanes could simply be closed off and removed . Little of the original interchange remained when the project was finished . 
"
" To save time and money , innovative construction methods were employed : The original plans called for the segments of the long ramps and spans ( used to direct @-@ connect roads ) to be made of steel , but because building with steel would interfere with heavy traffic flow during construction , cast @-@ in @-@ place segmental concrete was substituted in the plans . However , <unk> decided to use <unk> concrete segmental bridges , rather than casting the bridge elements in place , and used a unique machine , designed and constructed by Deal <unk> of Italy and costing about $ 1 million , to move the pieces into place . 
"
" During the construction , 2 @.@ 2 million cubic yards of <unk> was used , 350 @,@ 000 cubic yards of concrete was mixed on site , and 300 @,@ 000 square feet of retaining walls were built . Additionally , 40 @,@ 000 feet of drilled shafts and 75 @,@ 000 linear feet of drainage pipe were completed . In addition to the construction of 43 permanent bridges , six temporary bridges were built , resulting in 2 @.@ 3 million square feet of bridge deck . 
"
" The project was designed by the <unk> Corporation who provided professional engineering consultation throughout the construction , which had begun in 2002 and was completed in December 2005 , more than 13 months sooner than planned .

" By the 1970s and 1980s , a century of intense cattle grazing had reduced much of the riparian vegetation along stream banks in the <unk> Creek Mountains and elsewhere in the Great Basin . As a result , stream banks were eroding and upland vegetation was encroaching into riparian zones . <unk> populations declined as grazing cattle eliminated young trees , decreasing shade over streams and raising water temperatures . These conditions put the rare <unk> <unk> trout population at risk . Since the <unk> was officially designated as a threatened species , environmental groups began advocating the cancellation of grazing permits in the <unk> Creek Mountains .

" Beginning in the early 1970s , the Bureau of Land Management identified damaged riparian zones and began projects to restore natural habitat in those areas . Approximately 20 @,@ 000 <unk> trees were planted along streams , small dams were put together to create more pools in the streams , and fencing was added to protect riparian zones from grazing .

" As environmentalists pressed the <unk> to close much of the <unk> Creek Mountains to grazing , frustrated ranchers joined the <unk> Rebellion seeking to protect their grazing <unk> . Initially , it appeared that the issue of grazing in the range would produce prolonged litigation with appeals potentially lasting decades . However , in 1988 , interest groups representing all sides of the issue joined to form the <unk> Creek Mountain Working Group . The group 's goal was to find a solution acceptable to everyone — a plan that would protect both the land 's ecological health and ranchers ' economic needs .

" Over the next several years , the group continued to meet and discuss options for restoring the land while meeting the economic needs of local ranchers . Meetings were all open to the public .

" The group eventually endorsed a grazing management plan that provided for both the ecological health of sensitive riparian areas and the economic well @-@ being of ranchers . In 1989 , the <unk> Ranch agreed to rest two grazing <unk> totaling 50 @,@ 000 acres ( 20 @,@ 000 ha ) to restore critical stream <unk> and mountain pastures . The <unk> 's <unk> on Fifteen Mile Creek was rested for three years , and its <unk> Creek pasture received a five @-@ year rest before grazing was resumed . In addition , the grazing season in mountain pastures was reduced from four months to two , and the total number of cattle released in the <unk> areas was reduced from 3 @,@ 800 to 2 @,@ 200 .

" The episode features guest appearances by the members of the band Kiss — Peter Criss , Ace <unk> , Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley — who each portray both themselves and a small cameo role .

Only the <unk> battalion reported that they were in place on time .

" As the Marines formed into a <unk> @-@ shaped line around Hill 123 , Tamura 's battalion began a series of frontal assaults on the hill , charging up the saddle from Hill 80 and up from below the east side of the ridge .

This gun , which "" could have turned the tide in favor of the Japanese , "" however , was disabled by a faulty firing pin . At midnight , during a short lull in the fighting , <unk> ordered Parachute Companies B and C to advance from behind Hill 123 to strengthen his left flank . With fixed bayonets , the <unk> swept forward , killing Japanese soldiers who had overrun the Marine lines and were apparently preparing to roll up the Marine lines from the flank , and took position on the east side of the hill . Marines from other units , as well as members of <unk> 's command staff , including Major Bailey , took ammunition and grenades under fire to the Marines around Hill 123 , who were running critically low .

About 100 Japanese soldiers still remained in the open on the south slope of Hill 80 , perhaps preparing for one more charge on Hill 123 . At first light , three U.S. Army aircraft from the 67th Fighter Squadron at Henderson Field , acting on a request personally delivered by Bailey , <unk> the Japanese near Hill 80 and killed most of them , with the few survivors retreating back into the jungle .

" Air Rhodesia Flight <unk> was a scheduled passenger flight that was shot down by the Zimbabwe People 's Revolutionary Army ( <unk> ) on 3 September 1978 , during the Rhodesian Bush War . The aircraft involved , a Vickers Viscount named the <unk> , was flying the last leg of Air Rhodesia 's regular scheduled service from Victoria Falls to the capital Salisbury , via the resort town of <unk> . 
"
" Soon after Flight <unk> took off , a group of <unk> guerrillas scored a direct hit on its starboard wing with a Soviet @-@ made <unk> 2 surface @-@ to @-@ air infrared <unk> missile , critically damaging the aircraft and forcing an emergency landing . An attempted belly landing in a cotton field just west of <unk> was <unk> by an unseen ditch , which caused the plane to cartwheel and break up . Of the 52 passengers and four crew , 38 died in this crash ; the insurgents then approached the wreckage , rounded up the 10 survivors they could see and massacred them with automatic gunfire . Three passengers survived by hiding in the surrounding bush , while a further five lived because they had gone to look for water before the guerrillas arrived . 
"
" <unk> leader Joshua <unk> publicly claimed responsibility for shooting down the <unk> in an interview with the BBC 's Today programme the same evening , saying the aircraft had been used for military purposes , but denied that his men had killed survivors on the ground . The majority of <unk> , both black and white , saw the attack as an act of terrorism . A fierce white Rhodesian backlash followed against perceived enemies , with many whites becoming <unk> <unk> and suspicious of blacks in general , even though few black <unk> supported attacks of this kind . Reports viewing the attack negatively appeared in international journals such as Time magazine , but there was almost no acknowledgement of it by overseas governments , much to the Rhodesian government 's <unk> . 
"
" <unk> between <unk> and Prime Minister Ian Smith , which had been progressing <unk> , were immediately suspended by the furious <unk> , with Smith calling <unk> a "" monster "" . On 10 September , Smith announced the extension of martial law over selected areas . The Rhodesian Security Forces launched several retaliatory strikes into Zambia and Mozambique over the following months , attacking both <unk> and its rival , the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army ( ZANLA ) . The attack on <unk> in particular brought great controversy as many of those killed were refugees camping in and around guerrilla positions . Five months later , in February 1979 , <unk> shot down Air Rhodesia Flight <unk> , another civilian flight , in an almost identical incident .

" A dispute over the terms for the granting of full sovereignty to the self @-@ governing colony of Rhodesia ( or Southern Rhodesia ) led the colonial government , headed by Prime Minister Ian Smith , to <unk> declare independence from the United Kingdom on 11 November 1965 . The idea of "" no independence before majority rule "" had recently gained ground in Britain and elsewhere amid decolonisation , and Rhodesia 's government was dominated by the country 's white minority , so the unilateral declaration went <unk> internationally . Britain and the United Nations imposed economic sanctions on Rhodesia . 
"
" Two rival communist @-@ backed black nationalist groups initiated military campaigns to overthrow the government and introduce majority rule : the Chinese @-@ aligned Zimbabwe African National Union ( <unk> ) , mostly comprising <unk> , created the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army ( ZANLA ) and adopted aspects of <unk> doctrine , while the <unk> @-@ dominated Zimbabwe African People 's Union ( <unk> ) , aligned with Soviet @-@ style <unk> – <unk> and the Warsaw Pact , mobilised the Zimbabwe People 's Revolutionary Army ( <unk> ) . These guerrilla armies proceeded to wage what they called the "" Second <unk> "" against the Rhodesian government and security forces . The resulting conflict , the Rhodesian Bush War , began in earnest in December 1972 , when ZANLA attacked <unk> and <unk> <unk> in north @-@ eastern Rhodesia . 
"
" After the security forces mounted a successful counter @-@ insurgency campaign during 1973 and 1974 , developments overseas caused the conflict 's momentum to shift in the insurgents ' favour . The leftist Carnation Revolution of April 1974 caused Portugal to withdraw its key economic support for Smith 's administration , and led to Mozambique 's independence the following year as a communist state openly allied with <unk> . Around the same time , Rhodesia 's other main <unk> , South Africa , adopted a <unk> initiative that forced a ceasefire , giving the guerrillas time to regroup . Following the abortive Victoria Falls Conference of August 1975 , Smith and the <unk> leader Joshua <unk> held unsuccessful talks between December 1975 and March 1976 . <unk> and <unk> announced in October 1976 , during the run @-@ up to the unsuccessful Geneva Conference in December , that they would <unk> attend conferences as a joint "" Patriotic Front "" . 
"
" In March 1978 , Smith and non @-@ militant nationalist groups headed by Bishop <unk> <unk> , the Reverend <unk> <unk> and Chief Jeremiah <unk> agreed what became the "" Internal Settlement "" . This created a joint black – white transitional government , with the country due to be reconstituted as Zimbabwe Rhodesia in June 1979 , pursuant to <unk> elections . <unk> and <unk> were invited to participate , but refused ; <unk> <unk> dubbed Smith 's black colleagues "" the blacksmiths "" . <unk> proclaimed 1978 to be "" The Year of the People "" as the war continued . Officials from <unk> 's United African National Council , sent to the provinces to explain the Internal Settlement to rural blacks , were killed by Marxist – <unk> guerrillas . <unk> also began to target Christian missionaries , <unk> in the killing of nine British missionaries and four children at <unk> Mission near the Mozambican border on 23 June . 
"
" The transitional government was badly received abroad , partly because the Internal Settlement kept control of law enforcement , the military , the judiciary and the civil service under white control . No country recognised Rhodesia 's interim administration . Smith again worked to bring <unk> into the government , hoping this would lend it some <unk> domestically , prompt diplomatic recognition overseas , and help the security forces defeat ZANLA . Starting on 14 August 1978 , he attended secret meetings with <unk> in <unk> , Zambia ( where <unk> was based ) , doing so with the assistance of the mining corporation <unk> . Attempts were made to also involve the <unk> leader Robert <unk> , but <unk> would have no part in the talks . According to the South African military historian <unk> <unk> , negotiations between Smith and <unk> progressed well and "" seemed on the verge of success "" by the start of September 1978 . On 2 September , Smith and <unk> revealed publicly that the secret meetings had taken place .

" Temple 33 was a funerary pyramid erected over the tomb of <unk> Chan K 'awiil I ( known as <unk> 48 ) in the North Acropolis . It started life in the Early Classic as a wide basal platform decorated with large stucco masks that flanked the stairway . Later in the Early Classic a new superstructure was added , with its own masks and decorated panels . During the Hiatus a third stage was built over the earlier constructions , the stairway was demolished and another royal burial , of an unidentified ruler , was set into the structure ( <unk> 23 ) . While the new pyramid was being built another high ranking tomb ( <unk> 24 ) was inserted into the rubble core of the building . The pyramid was then completed , standing 33 metres ( 108 ft ) tall .

" Tropical Storm <unk> formed as a tropical wave that emerged off the west coast of Africa near the end of August 2008 .

As the depression became more organized , an eye @-@ like feature developed in the upper levels of the system . The depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm <unk> six hours after forming . <unk> was located in an area which was supportive for rapid intensification but was not forecast to intensify quickly .

" <unk> continued to intensify throughout the afternoon as the storm became more symmetrical . However , due to the location of the storm , there was a lack of accurate wind speed readings , and the National Hurricane Center was uncertain of its actual intensity . Despite the lack of wind shear around the storm , the center became slightly exposed and ceased further intensification . The storm was also heading into an area where shear was <unk> to significantly increase due to an upper @-@ level trough diving southward . Despite convection being partially removed from the center of <unk> , the storm intensified slightly in the early morning hours on September 3 as thunderstorm activity to the south of the center became more organized . The intensification was forecast to be short in duration as the trough to the north was deepening , causing the wind shear to the west to become stronger . 
"
" <unk> reached its peak intensity of 65 mph ( 100 km / h ) around 8 a.m. ( <unk> ) as it continued to become more organized . However , there were indications that it had already begun to weaken . <unk> towards the north was becoming restricted and arc clouds began emanating from the storm , a sign that dry air was entering the system . During the afternoon hours , the structure of <unk> began to rapidly deteriorate as strong wind shear and dry air took their toll . By the late night , the center was almost completely exposed and only a band of convection persisted near the center .

" Despite continuing effects from the strong wind shear , a large , deep burst of convection formed in the northern <unk> of <unk> .

Due to the lack of convection , <unk> was downgraded to a Tropical Depression at <unk> ( <unk> ) with winds of 35 mph ( 55 km / h ) . Since there was no convection around the system , it would have normally been classified a remnant low but , due to the possibility of the storm <unk> over the next several days , it was considered a tropical depression . The next morning , <unk> was downgraded to a remnant low as strong wind shear and dry air caused the demise of the storm . No redevelopment was expected with <unk> as it began to move over colder waters and remain under strong wind shear until it dissipated .

On September 8 , wind shear took over the system again . <unk> around the remnant low was torn away and the low was exposed once more . The National Hurricane Center did not state the chance of regeneration once the low became exposed . Finally , on September 9 , wind shear and dry air led to the remnants of <unk> deteriorating into an open wave . However , on September 10 , the remnants of <unk> redeveloped and global models picked up on the reformed system .

" Scientology , founded in the early 1950s in the United States by L. Ron Hubbard and today claiming to be represented in 150 countries , has been a very controversial new religious movement . Its stated <unk> aim is to "" clear the planet "" , to bring about an enlightened age in which every individual has overcome their psychological limitations . Scientology teaches that the source of people 's <unk> lies in "" <unk> "" , psychological <unk> acquired in the course of painful experiences , which can be cleared through a type of <unk> called "" <unk> "" made available by the Church of Scientology . 
"
" The fact that Scientologists have to pay large fees for <unk> and other Scientology services has brought controversy to Scientology throughout much of its history , with governments <unk> it as a profit @-@ making enterprise rather than as a religion . Critics maintain that Scientology is "" a business @-@ driven , <unk> <unk> , totalitarian ideology with world @-@ dominating aspirations "" , and that it tricks its members into parting with significant sums of money for Scientology courses . Scientology has fought <unk> lawsuits to defend itself against such charges and to pursue legal recognition as a religion . These efforts have been partly successful – Scientology has gained recognition as a tax @-@ exempt religious group in a number of countries , most notably in Australia in 1983 and the United States in 1993 , and in 2007 won an important case at the European Court of Human Rights , which <unk> Russia for failing to register Scientology as a religion . 
"
" The German government has said that it does not consider Scientology a religion , but a "" commercial enterprise with a history of taking advantage of vulnerable individuals and an extreme dislike of any criticism "" whose "" totalitarian structure and methods may pose a risk to Germany 's democratic society "" . Accordingly , the German government has taken a very strong stance against the organization . Germany is not alone in opposing Scientology ; in France , the Church of Scientology was convicted of organized fraud in October 2009 , after a court found that members had been manipulated into paying large sums for Scientology products , and the Church only narrowly escaped being banned altogether . Scientology is similarly controversial in Belgium , Greece and the UK . 
"
" On the subject of Scientology 's status as a religion , the German government has pointed to a 1995 decision by the Federal Labor Court of Germany . That court , noting Hubbard 's instruction that Scientologists should "" make money , make more money – make other people produce so as to make more money "" , came to the conclusion that "" Scientology <unk> to be a ' church ' merely as a cover to pursue its economic interests "" . In the same decision , the court also found that Scientology uses "" <unk> and totalitarian practices "" . Given the lessons of Germany 's 20th @-@ century history , in which the country came to be dominated by a fascist movement that started from similarly small beginnings , Germany is very wary of any ideological movement that might appear to be seeking a position of absolute power . <unk> in Scientology writings to the elimination of "" parasites "" and "" <unk> "" people who stand in the way of progress towards Scientology 's <unk> world "" without <unk> , without criminals and without war "" evoke uncomfortable parallels with Nazism , and have led to Scientology being classified as an "" <unk> political movement "" . 
"
" To further justify its stance , the German government has also pointed to the long history of U.S. court cases involving Scientology , including the conviction of 11 top Scientologists in 1979 and 1980 for a conspiracy involving the infiltration of U.S. government agencies , <unk> and the theft of government documents , a 1994 U.S. Supreme Court finding that Scientology practices took place in a "" <unk> environment "" , and Scientology 's track record of pursuing its critics through malicious court cases and private investigators . In examining the potential threat posed by Scientology the German government has noted that Scientology organizations are "" structured so as to make the individual <unk> and financially dependent on a Scientology system "" , and that members often abandon contact with friends and family .

This view of Scientology as a public enemy , <unk> adds , "" became a matter of political <unk> "" : senior political figures became involved in launching campaigns against Scientology , and being suspected of any association with it resulted in social <unk> . Stephen A. Kent , writing in 1998 , noted that officials at all levels of German government shared the insistence that Scientology should be suppressed . Scientology was viewed as "" a totalitarian , business @-@ driven organization [ ... ] guilty of significant human rights abuses .

" U.S. Department of State spokesman Nicholas Burns rejected the Nazi comparisons in the open letter as "" <unk> "" and distanced the U.S. government from Nazi comparisons made by the Church of Scientology , saying , "" We have criticized the Germans on this , but we aren 't going to support the Scientologists ' terror tactics against the German government . "" Chancellor <unk> , commenting on the letter , said that those who signed it "" don 't know a thing about Germany and don 't want to know .

" In February 1997 , a United States immigration court judge granted <unk> to a German Scientologist who claimed she would be subject to religious persecution in her homeland . In April 1997 , John <unk> met personally with U.S. President Bill Clinton at a conference in Philadelphia . <unk> later said Clinton assured him that he would "" really love to help "" with the "" issue over in Germany with Scientology "" . According to <unk> , Clinton recalled that "" he had a roommate years ago who was a Scientologist and had really liked him , and respected his views on it "" , stating that Scientologists "" were given an unfair hand in [ Germany ] and that he wanted to fix it "" . In September 1997 , John <unk> , Chick <unk> and fellow Scientologist Isaac Hayes were heard by the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe ( <unk> , also known as the Helsinki Commission ) , voicing their complaints about the treatment of Scientologists in Germany , and had a briefing with United States National Security <unk> Sandy Berger , whom Clinton had assigned to be "" the administration 's Scientology point person "" . The German ambassador responded with a letter to the <unk> stating that the German government had come to the conclusion that Scientology 's "" pseudo @-@ scientific courses can seriously jeopardize individuals ' mental and physical health and that it exploits its members "" , adding that "" membership can lead to psychological and physical dependency , to financial ruin , and even to suicide .

" In 2000 , the German Stern magazine published the results of its investigation of the <unk> case . It asserted that several rejection letters which the woman had submitted as part of her <unk> application – ostensibly from potential employers who were rejecting her because she was a Scientologist – had in fact been written by fellow Scientologists at her request and that of Scientology 's Office of Special Affairs , and that she was in personal financial trouble and about to go on trial for tax <unk> at the time she applied for <unk> . On a 2000 visit to Clearwater , Florida , <unk> <unk> of the Scientology Task Force for the Hamburg Interior Authority likewise alleged that the <unk> case had been part of an "" orchestrated effort "" by Scientology undertaken "" for political gain "" , and "" a spectacular abuse of the U.S. system "" . German expatriate Scientologists resident in Clearwater , in turn , accused <unk> of <unk> a "" hate campaign "" in Germany that had "" ruined the lives and fortunes of scores of Scientologists "" and maintained that Scientologists had not "" exaggerated their plight for political gain in the United States .

" The U.S. Department of State 's 2012 report on religious freedom in Germany , published in 2013 , stated that "" The status of the Church of Scientology remains in <unk> .

" <unk> as a coastal defence ship in 1921 , Asahi was disarmed two years later to meet the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty , after which she served as a training and submarine depot ship . She was modified into a submarine salvage and rescue ship before being placed in reserve in 1928 . Asahi was recommissioned in late 1937 , after the start of the Second <unk> @-@ Japanese War , and used to transport Japanese troops . In 1938 , she was converted into a repair ship and based first at Japanese @-@ occupied Shanghai , China , and then Cam <unk> Bay , French Indochina , from late 1938 to 1941 .

" Combat experience in the First <unk> @-@ Japanese War of 1894 – 95 convinced the Imperial Japanese Navy of weaknesses in the <unk> École naval philosophy , which emphasized torpedo boats and commerce raiding to offset expensive heavily armoured ships .

These ships were paid for from the £ 30 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 indemnity paid by China after losing the First <unk> @-@ Japanese War . As with the earlier Fuji and <unk> classes , Japan lacked the technology and capability to construct its own battleships , and turned again to the United Kingdom for the four remaining battleships of the programme .

" The 1888 – 89 New Zealand Native football team was a New Zealand rugby union team that toured Britain , Ireland , Australia and New Zealand in 1888 and 1889 . It mostly comprised players of Māori ancestry , and also included some <unk> ( white New Zealanders ) . A wholly private <unk> , the tour was not under the auspices of any official rugby authority ; it was organised by New Zealand international player Joseph <unk> , promoted by civil servant Thomas <unk> , and managed by James Scott , a <unk> . The <unk> were the first New Zealand team to perform a <unk> , and also the first to wear all black . They played 107 rugby matches during the tour , as well as a small number of Victorian Rules football and association football matches in Australia . Having made a significant impact on the development of New Zealand rugby , the <unk> were inducted into the International Rugby Board Hall of Fame in 2008 . 
"
" After a preliminary tour of New Zealand in 1888 , the side travelled to England via Melbourne and Suez . The Māori players initially provoked curiosity due to their race , but the British press subsequently expressed some surprise that the side was not as "" Māori "" as they had expected . Playing their first match , on 3 October against Surrey , the team was subjected to a taxing match schedule , and frequently played three matches per week . Their early matches included a 9 – 0 loss to Middlesex , but their form improved in November , when they won 10 of their 13 matches . The team played its first international match on 1 December , against Ireland , and won 13 – 4 . This was followed by a win over one of the strongest English county teams , Yorkshire , and a 5 – 0 defeat against the Wales national team . By January 1889 the <unk> had played 36 matches in less than three months , winning 22 of them ; they had spent most of their time in the north of England , where the playing strength was strongest and the crowds largest and most profitable . 
"
" In a return match on 19 January , Yorkshire fielded a stronger side than in the first match and inflicted one of the <unk> ' heaviest losses , a 16 – 4 defeat . The team then went undefeated until 16 February , when they faced England . Officials of the strictly amateur Rugby Football Union ( RFU ) had become increasingly concerned at the behaviour of the New Zealanders , regarding them as unsportsmanlike , and tensions reached a nadir in the aftermath of the England international , during which the RFU secretary George Rowland Hill , <unk> the game , awarded a number of controversial tries to England , prompting three of the <unk> to temporarily leave the field in protest ; England eventually won 7 – 0 . The <unk> apologised afterwards for their behaviour , but the damage was not repaired . The New Zealanders left England without an official send @-@ off , and travelled to Australia where they toured Victoria , New South Wales and Queensland . They then returned to New Zealand , where they displayed a level of combination not seen in their home country before . They went 31 games undefeated before losing their final match , on 24 August 1889 , 7 – 2 to Auckland . 
"
" The <unk> ' final record in rugby matches was 78 wins , 6 draws and 23 losses . They introduced a number of tactical innovations to New Zealand rugby on their return home , and their tour contributed to the formation of the New Zealand Rugby Football Union in 1892 .

When James Scott , a <unk> , subsequently joined the partnership , the three men decided that <unk> would be the team 's captain , Scott its manager and <unk> its promoter . 
"
" <unk> started assembling a team for the tour in early 1888 . He had difficulties assembling a squad due to player availability , and failed to secure the talented Jack <unk> due to his university commitments . Some Māori players who initially agreed to play later pulled out when the eligibility criteria were relaxed to allow squad members who were only part @-@ Māori . Twenty Māori or part @-@ Māori players joined the squad ; five <unk> ( white New Zealand ) players were added after the team lost to Auckland . Due to the inclusion of these <unk> players the team was renamed from the "" New Zealand <unk> "" to the "" New Zealand Native Football Representatives "" . The final squad comprised 26 players ( including <unk> ) ; of these at least five were full @-@ <unk> Māori , while fourteen had a Māori mother and a <unk> father . The parentage of some of the players is unknown .

The last two matches that month were a loss to <unk> and a 9 – 0 victory over Liverpool and District . The team had played thirteen fixtures during November and won ten of them . By this point , the team was beset by injuries – of the fifteen players that played against <unk> County on 24 November , five had injuries .

In the second half Wales continued to push their advantage when Alexander <unk> <unk> the ball into the <unk> ' 25 ; this was collected by Sydney Nicholls , who managed to get the ball across the try line , allowing Jim <unk> to score . <unk> for the <unk> and <unk> for Wales both subsequently came close to scoring tries , but there were no further scores in the game . 
"
" The match was also of historical importance because of the Welsh tactics employed . In the 1886 Home Nations Championship Wales had <unk> the four three @-@ quarter system , wherein the team would play with eight forwards rather than nine , and instead employ an extra centre three @-@ quarter . The system was deemed a failure and was particularly unpopular with star Welsh player Arthur Gould , whose formidable ability as a back allowed his club team Newport to retain the additional forward . With Gould working in the West Indies , Wales again tried the four three @-@ quarter system against the <unk> , and its success saw the team permanently adopt the system . Within six years the other three Home Countries had adopted four three @-@ quarter style of play . 
"
" Before they left Wales , the <unk> played Swansea and two other local clubs , Newport , and Cardiff . They defeated Swansea for their first win in Wales , and followed this up with a victory over Newport in front of 8 @,@ 000 spectators . They finished their Welsh matches , and the year , with a 4 – 1 loss to Cardiff in front of a partisan crowd .

" Yorkshire had been criticised in the press for fielding a weakened line @-@ up against the <unk> when the sides first met in December . After the unexpected loss , Yorkshire were determined to make <unk> and a strong side was selected for the county , including Fred <unk> , Richard <unk> and John Willie <unk> , all of whom would appear for England against the <unk> later that season . Described as "" knocked about "" and "" stale "" , the <unk> struggled to compete against such strong opposition , and Yorkshire scored three converted tries before a try to <unk> left the scores at 9 – 1 at half @-@ time .

" The match against England was causing the <unk> ' players and management problems before it had even begun . The team manager , Scott , was in dispute with the RFU over where the match should be played – the RFU were adamant that the match should take place at <unk> 's ground , but Scott wanted the game to proceed at The Oval , where a larger crowd , and therefore higher gate receipts , could be secured . The strictly amateur RFU establishment were already suspicious of the profit @-@ making motives of the <unk> , and were unwilling to yield on the selection of venue . The RFU was also in dispute with the other Home <unk> over the formation of the International Rugby Football Board ( <unk> ) . Following a disputed try in an England – Scotland international match in 1888 , the Scottish authorities had pushed for the establishment of an international body to oversee the game , but the RFU insisted that they would only join if they held a deciding vote , arguing that they deserved this as they were , they asserted , the senior body , and had the most member clubs . Ireland , Wales and Scotland consequently refused to play against England until 1891 , when , following arbitration , the RFU relented and joined the <unk> . The absence of international matches was a factor in England agreeing to face the <unk> on 16 February 1889 . 
"
" The line @-@ ups selected for the 16 February match were both strong , and close to full strength . Though 12 of the England side had not played internationally before , all were experienced at domestic level . The match was <unk> by Rowland Hill , who had also <unk> the <unk> ' first match in Britain , against Surrey . The opening of the first half was a scoreless affair , with much tackling and <unk> on the heavy ground . Later in the half England scored two tries through Harry Bedford , but both were disputed by the <unk> , who claimed that one of their players had grounded the ball in @-@ goal . England took the two @-@ try advantage into the second half . 
"
" Early in the second half a third disputed try was scored by the English . The try and its aftermath caused controversy and a rift between the <unk> and the RFU . <unk> attempted to tackle the English player <unk> , and in the process ripped his shorts off . The <unk> quickly formed a circle around <unk> to allow him to replace his clothing without being seen . While this was happening one of the English players , Frank <unk> , picked up the ball and scored a try . The New Zealanders protested , believing that play had stopped after claiming <unk> had called "" dead ball "" – but Hill awarded the try , prompting three of the Native players , Dick <unk> , Williams , and <unk> <unk> , to leave the field in protest . The <unk> players were eventually persuaded to return , but not before Hill had <unk> play . <unk> was very critical of Hill , particularly because he was also Secretary of the RFU . <unk> wrote after the tour that "" gross as these errors were , they were insignificant when compared with another that Mr Hill committed at the outset of the game , <unk> , <unk> at all in that game "" . The disputed try was followed by a final try for the English , who ultimately won 7 – 0 . 
"
" The RFU , at Hill 's instigation , promptly demanded an apology from the <unk> ' captain of the day , Edward <unk> , who had led the team as Joe <unk> was injured . The English authorities of the time believed that the decision of a referee was above question , and that protesting a decision as the New Zealanders had done was unsportsmanlike . The RFU threatened to bar any of their affiliated players – in other words , the entire rugby playing population of England – from facing the <unk> if they did not <unk> . <unk> swiftly sent an apology by telegram , but this was deemed inadequate ; he therefore sent another , four days after the game : 
"
" The London establishment that governed the game were disturbed by the New Zealanders ' approach to the game ; reports of rough and over @-@ aggressive play by the <unk> had steadily increased in frequency since their arrival in Britain . In the north of England , criticism of the visitors ' <unk> was rarer ; the tourists were accepted as playing the game in the same spirit as their local opponents , which in the north was a more working class sport than in the south . Some of the <unk> , including Joe <unk> , accused the RFU and the English press of hypocrisy , claiming that they were quick to <unk> the New Zealanders for rough play , yet tolerant of similar behaviour from their own players .

From there they travelled north and won two matches before losing to Leigh . After a win over <unk> , there was a defeat to Oldham , played on a ground <unk> said was so frozen it was dangerous . After reversing their previous loss to Halifax with a 6 – 0 win , the <unk> suffered a loss to Barrow and District on 7 March . The New Zealanders then had a run of seven straight wins before a 1 – 1 draw with Hull . <unk> were then defeated for the second time in two weeks in the tourists ' last match in northern England .

" The team struggled to find an opponent for their final match in Britain . They eventually played Southern Counties , and beat them 3 – 1 . This was their <unk> match in the British Isles and their 49th victory . The authorities and press in London continued to view the team negatively , and the <unk> boarded ship without a formal farewell . This perceived <unk> from the RFU provoked some criticism from the press outside London , as well as from the team manager Scott , who felt that with the team 's official apology after the England match , the controversy should have put to rest .

" The majority of the <unk> left Plymouth on 29 March ( <unk> and Pie <unk> followed a week later ) . They arrived in Melbourne in May , where the team played mostly Victorian Rules football , hoping to make more money that way . Although the side had employed Jack <unk> to coach them in Victorian Rules during their tour of the British Isles , the heavy schedule and high injury count had left little time and energy for such training . As a result , the Victorian Rules matches were a failure ; the players ' <unk> with the rules , combined with the fact that most of the <unk> were rugby forwards ( and therefore less suited to the more open Victorian Rules ) , ensured that they failed to perform well on the field and struggled to attract large crowds . The side played nine Victorian Rules matches in total , including one in New South Wales , but won only three of them , all against relatively weak opposition . 
"
" The side 's success in their rugby matches contrasted to their failure in Victorian Rules – the New Zealanders played three rugby matches while in Victoria : against Melbourne , a Navy selection , and Victoria . The matches were all won , with their game against Victoria a 19 – 0 victory . After this they left for Sydney for further rugby matches , and defeated New South Wales 12 – 9 . After two further victories , the side again faced New South Wales , and won the match 16 – 12 . Another two victories followed , before the team played their only association football matches of the tour – both defeats . 
"
" The team travelled north to Queensland , where , as in New South Wales , rugby was the dominant code of football . Consequently , the team exclusively played rugby while in the region . The <unk> faced Queensland at the Association Ground in Brisbane . The 8000 spectators witnessed the New Zealanders overwhelm the <unk> to win 22 – 0 ; the <unk> did not exert themselves in the win , and the score did not reflect their dominance . After a further two matches , against <unk> and Ipswich ( both of whom were comfortably defeated ) , the team returned to Brisbane for a rematch with Queensland . In contrast to their first meeting , the first @-@ half was a close affair , and the two sides were tied at the conclusion of the half . Billy <unk> suffered a kick to the head , and had to retire early in the second @-@ half . Following the loss of <unk> , the play of the <unk> improved and they recovered to win 11 – 7 . Not long after the game concluded rumours circulated that some of the players had been offered ₤ 50 by <unk> to throw the game . <unk> later said : 
"
" It was on the occasion of this match that four of our players were thought , in racing <unk> , to be playing "" stiff "" , and that they had been got by some <unk> ; at all events , when accused of it at half @-@ time and cautioned , they played a different game in the second half . 
"
" The response from the team 's management was to suspend four players . The team travelled to <unk> , where they defeated the locals 19 – 0 . The <unk> included a replacement player for only the second time , Charles <unk> , after the <unk> reduced the playing strength of the side . The team then travelled back to New Zealand , and arrived in <unk> on 5 August .

Despite playing the match two players down , the <unk> comfortably defeated <unk> 16 – 3 . Following the side 's return to New Zealand , the <unk> Rugby Football Union demanded that the team 's management explain the accusations levelled at them in Queensland . <unk> responded by insisting that the players had only been suspended while an investigation was conducted , and that the management was confident no wrongdoing had occurred . The Northern Rugby Union ( since renamed Queensland Rugby Union ) summarised the incident and aftermath in the 1889 Queensland Rugby Union Annual : 
"
" ... it was apparent to a judge of the game that something was wrong with the <unk> , as they were not showing their usual dash and combination . Four members of the team were suspended , a charge being made against them of attempting the sell the match . The matter was bought before the <unk> Union , who passed the following resolution : That , having heard all available evidence regarding the charges against certain members of the Native Team , and having received an explicit denial of charges from the accused members and a satisfactory explanation from the management , we are of opinion that there are no facts before us <unk> the allegations ... 
"
" It is unlikely , given the attitude of the <unk> Rugby Union to the <unk> before their departure , that they would have dismissed the allegations if <unk> evidence had existed . The side was back to full strength following the return of their suspended players when the side faced <unk> in <unk> . The <unk> <unk> their opponents five tries to two , and won 11 – 8 . The side 's star player and half @-@ back , <unk> , stayed in <unk> when the team departed for <unk> . The side faced <unk> 's Bay , who were touring , in <unk> , and <unk> defeated them 13 – 2 . The <unk> ' play was praised by The Press : "" ... the <unk> of the black passed with remarkable accuracy and <unk> between their legs , over their shoulders , under their arms and with their feet "" . The side then faced Canterbury on 17 August , who they <unk> 15 – 0 . The report published in The Press said of the <unk> ' performance : 
"
" The play showed on Saturday afternoon was a fine exhibition of what several months of combination and practice will do ... it must be admitted they were far and away too good for our local men . In the loose , in the <unk> , <unk> , passing , <unk> , or running they were very much indeed Canterbury 's superior . Such runs as were made by <unk> at full back , by Madigan , <unk> , and W. <unk> , the passing of H. <unk> , F. <unk> , and all the backs as well as several forwards , the rushes of <unk> <unk> , Maynard , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , and the <unk> and <unk> powers of nearly every one , <unk> their opponents ... 
"
" The side left <unk> and travelled north where they played <unk> in Masterton . The match was won 10 – 8 , and the next day they faced Wellington , who they also defeated . The fixture against Wellington was nearly abandoned because Scott and the Wellington Rugby Union could not agree on a venue ; the match went ahead only when the Wellington officials agreed to cede the <unk> all profit from the match . After this the <unk> travelled to Auckland where they played their last match , against the province on 24 August . The match was lost 7 – 2 after each team scored two tries each , but the <unk> kicked a drop @-@ goal and a conversion . The loss ended a remarkable run of matches – the <unk> had a 31 @-@ game unbeaten streak in rugby matches that started with their victory over <unk> on 9 March ; the side won 30 , and drew one match between the defeats .

"
" The tour also prompted the eventual formation of the New Zealand Rugby Football Union ( <unk> , later renamed New Zealand Rugby Union ) in 1892 ; one reason for its formation was to ensure greater control over any future touring New Zealand sides . The <unk> sent an officially sanctioned New Zealand team , captained by <unk> , to tour Australia in 1893 .

" When the American Revolutionary War broke out in 1775 , the city of Charleston in the colony of South Carolina was a center of commerce in southern North America . The city 's citizens joined other colonists in opposing the British parliament 's attempts to tax them , and militia recruitment increased when word arrived of the April 1775 Battles of Lexington and Concord . Throughout 1775 and into 1776 , militia recruits arrived in the city from the colony 's <unk> , the city 's manufacturers and tradesmen began producing war materiel , and defensive fortifications began to take shape around the city .

" The plan was beset by difficulties from the start . The Irish expedition , originally supposed to depart at the beginning of December 1775 , was delayed by logistical difficulties , and its 2 @,@ 500 troops did not depart until February 13 , 1776 , escorted by 11 warships under the command of Admiral Sir Peter Parker . Clinton left Boston on January 20 with two companies of light infantry , and first stopped at New York City to confer with William Tryon , New York 's royal governor . Major General Charles Lee , sent by Major General George Washington to see to the defense of New York , <unk> arrived there the same day as Clinton . New York was at that time extremely tense ; <unk> forces were beginning to <unk> and evict <unk> , and the British fleet anchored there was having difficulty acquiring provisions . Despite this , Clinton made no secret that his final target was in the south . Lee observed that this was "" certainly a <unk> way of proceeding ; to communicate his full plan to the enemy is too novel to be credited . "" This was not even the first notice of the expedition to the colonists ; a letter intercepted in December had already provided intelligence that the British were planning to go to the South .

He met with the royal governors of North and South Carolina , Josiah Martin and William Campbell , and learned that the recruited Scottish <unk> had been defeated at Moore 's Creek Bridge two weeks earlier . Clinton also received pleas for assistance from the royal governor of Georgia , James Wright , who had been arrested , and then escaped to a navy ship .

" General Lee responded to the British landing with several actions . He began reinforcing positions on the mainland in case the British were intending to launch an attack directly on Charleston .

" General Clinton encountered the first major problem of the attack plan on June 17 .

He considered using boats to ferry the troops across , but the Americans , with timely advice from General Lee , adopted a strong defensive position that was virtually impossible to bombard from ships or the Long Island position .

Clinton reported that this meant that Admiral Parker would have "" the glory of being defeated alone .

" On the morning of June 28 , Fort Sullivan was defended by Colonel <unk> , commanding the 2nd South Carolina Regiment and a company of the 4th South Carolina Artillery , numbering 435 men .

Although many of Thunder 's shots landed in or near the fort , they had little effect ; according to <unk> , "" We had a <unk> in the middle , that swallowed them up instantly , and those that fell in the sand in and about the fort , were immediately buried "" . Thunder 's role in the action was also relatively short @-@ lived ; she had anchored too far away from the fort , and the <unk> of her mortars with extra powder to increase their range eventually led to them breaking out of their mounts . Owing to shortage of gunpowder , <unk> 's men were deliberate in the pace of their gunfire , and only a few officers actually aimed the cannons . They also fired in small <unk> , four cannon at a time . One British observer wrote , "" Their fire was surprisingly well served "" and it was "" slow , but decisive indeed ; they were very cool and took care not to fire except their guns were exceedingly well directed .

" Around noon the frigates <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> were sent on a roundabout route , avoiding some <unk> , to take a position from which they could enfilade the fort 's main firing platform and also cover one of the main escape routes from the fort . However , all three ships grounded on an <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> became entangled in the process . The British managed to <unk> <unk> and <unk> , but <unk> remained grounded , having moved too far onto the submerged <unk> .

" At the fort , <unk> ordered his men to concentrate their fire on the two large man @-@ of @-@ war ships , Bristol and Experiment , which took hit after hit from the fort 's guns . Chain shot fired at Bristol eventually destroyed much of her rigging and severely damaged both the <unk> and <unk> . One round hit her quarterdeck , slightly wounding Parker in the knee and thigh . The shot also tore off part of his <unk> , leaving his <unk> exposed . By mid @-@ afternoon , the defenders were running out of gunpowder , and their fire was briefly suspended .

"" Admiral Parker eventually sought to destroy the fort 's walls with persistent broadside <unk> . This strategy failed due to the <unk> nature of the <unk> wood used in its constructions ; the structure would <unk> , and it absorbed the <unk> rather than <unk> .

It is commonly stated that <unk> himself was also a doctor , though the earliest sources <unk> to this occur only in the second half of the 19th century . 
"
" By 1619 , Hu had moved to <unk> where he lived with his wife Wu . Their home on <unk> ( <unk> , now also known as <unk> <unk> ) , a hill located just within the northern city wall , served as a meeting @-@ house for like @-@ minded artists . Hu named it the Ten <unk> Studio ( <unk> , <unk> ) , after the ten bamboo plants that grew in front of the property . It functioned as the headquarters for his printing business , where he employed ten artisans including his two brothers <unk> and <unk> ( <unk> , art name <unk> , <unk> ) and his sons <unk> ( <unk> ) and <unk> ( <unk> , courtesy name <unk> ) . 
"
" During Hu 's lifetime , the Ming dynasty , which had ruled China for over 250 years , was overthrown and replaced by China 's last imperial dynasty , the Qing . Following the fall of the capital Beijing in 1644 , remnants of the imperial family and a few ministers set up a Ming loyalist regime in <unk> with Zhu <unk> on the throne as the <unk> Emperor . Hu , who was noted for his seal @-@ carving and facility with seal script , created a seal for the new Emperor . The court offered him the position of <unk> for the <unk> ( <unk> <unk> , <unk> ) as a reward , but he did not accept the role ( although he did accord himself the title of <unk> <unk> in some of his subsequent personal seals ) . 
"
" According to <unk> <unk> 's Lost History of the South ( <unk> <unk> , <unk> ) , prior to the Qing invasion of <unk> Hu studied at the National University there , and whilst a student was employed by the Ministry of <unk> to record official <unk> ; he produced the Imperial Promotion of Minor Learning ( Qin Ban <unk> , <unk> ) and the Record of <unk> <unk> ( <unk> Ji , <unk> ) as part of this work . As a result , he was promoted to the Ministry of Personnel and gained <unk> to the <unk> Academy , but before he could take up this appointment , Beijing had fallen to the <unk> rebellion . Since contemporaneous biographies ( <unk> 's work was not published until 1830 ) make no mention of these events , it has been suggested that they were fabricated after Hu 's death .

" Despite his reputation as an artist and seal @-@ <unk> , Hu was primarily a publisher . His publishing house , the Ten <unk> Studio , produced reference works on calligraphy , poetry and art ; medical textbooks ; books on etymology and <unk> ; and copies of as well as commentaries on the Confucian Classics . Unlike other publishers in the area , the Ten <unk> Studio did not publish works of narrative fiction such as plays or novels . This bias towards academia was likely a consequence of the studio 's location : the mountain on which Hu took up residence was just to the north of the <unk> <unk> ( National Academy ) , which provided a captive market for academic texts . Between 1627 and 1644 , the Ten <unk> Studio produced over twenty printed books of this kind , aimed at a wealthy , literary audience . The studio 's earliest publications were medical textbooks , the first of which , <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> ( <unk> <unk> , <unk> ) was published in 1631 and proved popular enough to be reissued ten years later . Hu 's brother <unk> was a medical <unk> and appears to have been the author of these books .

After the fall of the Ming Dynasty , Hu renamed the studio the Hall <unk> in the Past ( <unk> , <unk> ) as a sign of his affiliation with the previous dynasty , although the Ten <unk> imprint continued to be used . Despite Hu 's withdrawal from society after 1646 , the studio continued to publish well into the Qing dynasty , for the most part <unk> on seal impression catalogues showcasing Hu 's carving work . 
"
" The Ming dynasty had seen considerable advancement in the process of colour printing in China . At his studio , Hu <unk> experimented with various forms of <unk> printing , creating processes for producing multi @-@ coloured prints and <unk> printed designs . As a result , he was able to produce some of China 's first printed publications in colour , using a block printing technique known as "" <unk> block printing "" ( <unk> <unk> , <unk> ) . This system made use of multiple blocks , each carved with a different part of the final image and each bearing a different colour . It was a lengthy , <unk> process , requiring thirty to fifty engraved printing blocks and up to seventy <unk> and impressions to create a single image . Hu also employed a related form of multiple @-@ block printing called "" set @-@ block printing "" ( <unk> <unk> , <unk> ) , which had existed since the Yuan period some 200 years earlier but had only recently come into fashion again . He refined these block printing techniques by developing a process for <unk> some of the ink off the blocks before printing ; this enabled him to achieve <unk> and <unk> of shades which were not previously possible . 
"
" In some images , Hu employed a blind <unk> technique ( known as "" <unk> designs "" ( <unk> , <unk> ) or "" <unk> blocks "" ( <unk> , <unk> ) , using an <unk> , <unk> block to stamp designs onto paper . He used this to create white relief effects for clouds and for highlights on water or plants . This was a relatively new process , having been invented by Hu 's contemporary Wu <unk> , who was also a <unk> @-@ based publisher . Wu had used this technique for the first time in his book Wisteria Studio <unk> Paper ( <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> ) , published in <unk> . Both Hu and Wu used <unk> to create decorative writing papers , the sale of which provided a <unk> income for the Ten <unk> Studio .

" Hu 's most notable work is the Ten <unk> Studio Manual of Painting and <unk> ( <unk> <unk> , <unk> ) , an anthology of around 320 prints by around thirty different artists ( including Hu himself ) , published in 1633 . It consists of eight sections , covering calligraphy , bamboo , flowers , rocks , birds and animals , plums , orchids and fruit . Some of these sections had been released previously as single volumes . As well as a collection of artworks , it was also intended as an artistic <unk> , with instructions on correct brush position and technique and several pictures designed for <unk> to copy . Although these instructions only appear in the sections on orchids and bamboo , the book still remains the first example of a <unk> and analytical approach to Chinese painting . In this book , Hu used his multiple @-@ block printing methods to obtain <unk> of colour in the images , rather than obvious outlines or overlaps . The manual is bound in the "" butterfly binding "" ( <unk> <unk> , <unk> ) style , whereby whole @-@ <unk> illustrations are folded so that each occupies a double @-@ page spread . This binding style allows the reader to lay the book flat in order to look at a particular image . Cambridge University Library released a complete digital scan of the manual , including all writings and illustrations in August , 2015 . Said Charles <unk> , Head of the Cambridge University Chinese Department , "" The binding is so fragile , and the manual so delicate , that until it was <unk> , we have never been able to let anyone look through it or study it – despite its <unk> importance to scholars . "" 
"
" This volume went on to influence colour printing across China , where it paved the way for the later but better @-@ known Manual of the <unk> <unk> Garden ( <unk> <unk> <unk> ) , and also in Japan , where it was reprinted and foreshadowed the development in <unk> @-@ e of the colour <unk> printing process known as <unk> @-@ e <unk> . The popularity of the Ten <unk> Studio Manual was such that print runs continued to be produced all the way through to the late Qing dynasty . 
"
" Hu also produced the work Ten <unk> Studio <unk> Paper ( <unk> <unk> , <unk> ) , a collection of paper samples , which made use of the <unk> stamped <unk> technique to make the illustrations stand out in relief . Whilst primarily a catalogue of decorative writing papers , it also contained paintings of rocks , people , ritual vessels and other subjects . The book was bound in the "" wrapped back "" ( <unk> <unk> , <unk> ) style , in which the <unk> pages are folded , stacked , and <unk> along the open edges . Originally published in 1644 , it was reissued in four volumes between 1934 and 1941 by <unk> <unk> and Lu <unk> , and revised and republished again in 1952 .

So severe was this threat that a major invasion of the Spanish Philippines had been planned from British India during 1797 , but had been called off following the Treaty of <unk> <unk> in Europe and the possibility of a major war in India between the British East India Company and the Kingdom of Mysore . 
"
" To ensure the safety of the merchant ships gathering at <unk> in the winter of 1797 – 98 , the British commander in the East Indies , Rear @-@ Admiral Peter <unk> , sent a convoy to China escorted by the frigates HMS <unk> and HMS Fox and commanded by Captain Edward Cooke . After completing his mission Cooke decided to investigate the state of readiness of Spanish forces in Manila himself . He was also intrigued by reports that a ship carrying treasure was due to sail from Manila , which would make a valuable prize . <unk> in <unk> and accompanied by Captain Pulteney Malcolm in Fox , Cooke reached the Spanish capital on 13 January 1798 . 
"
" <unk> in Manila Bay , Cooke pretended that his ships were French vessels and successfully lured successive <unk> of Spanish officials aboard , taking them prisoner in turn . Once he had determined from his captives the state of defences in Manila , that the treasure ship had been <unk> at <unk> and that the Spanish squadron was undergoing extensive repairs and thus unavailable for operations , he sent a raiding party against a squadron of gunboats in the mouth of the <unk> River . <unk> the gunboats in a bloodless attack , Cooke then released his prisoners and sailed southwards , unsuccessfully assaulting <unk> before returning to <unk> .

" In 1796 , after three years of the French Revolutionary Wars , Spain and the French Republic signed the Treaty of San <unk> . The secret terms of this treaty required Spain to renounce its alliance with Great Britain and subsequently to declare war on its former ally . In the East Indies this shift of political allegiance meant that the dominant British forces in the region were faced with the threat of attack from the Spanish Philippines to the east . Britain dominated the East Indies in 1796 , controlling the trade routes through the Indian Ocean from the ports of Bombay , Madras and Calcutta . Dutch Ceylon , the Dutch Cape Colony and parts of the Dutch East Indies had been captured in 1795 , and the French presence in the region had been confined to Île de France and a few subsidiary islands in the Western Indian Ocean . 
"
" Some of the most important trade routes began at <unk> and <unk> in Qing Dynasty China . Early in each year a large convoy known as the "" China Fleet "" , composed of large East <unk> merchant ships in the employ of the British East India Company , sailed <unk> to Europe from <unk> laden with tea and other commercial cargo . This convoy was economically significant to Britain : one convoy in 1804 was valued at over £ 8 million ( the equivalent of £ 600 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 as of 2016 ) . In January 1797 the convoy had been attacked by the French squadron in the East Indies , comprising six frigates commanded by <unk> @-@ <unk> Pierre César Charles de <unk> . In the ensuing <unk> Strait Incident the commander deceived <unk> into believing that the <unk> convoy contained disguised ships of the line and the French admiral retreated , only learning of his error on his return to Île de France . There was considerable concern in India that <unk> might try again in 1798 , or that the Spanish , who maintained a powerful squadron at <unk> , might make an attempt of their own . 
"
" <unk> 's initial impulse on learning in November 1796 of the impending declaration of war between Britain and Spain was to draw up plans for a major invasion of the Philippines , centred on Manila in repetition of the successful British capture of Manila in <unk> . Co @-@ operating with the Governor @-@ General of India Sir John Shore and Colonel Arthur <unk> among others , a substantial naval and military forces were earmarked for the operation which was in the advance planning stages , when unexpected news arrived in India in August 1797 announcing the Treaty of <unk> <unk> which brought the War of the First Coalition to an end . Britain now faced France and Spain alone , while <unk> from the Tipu Sultan of the Kingdom of Mysore , an old opponent of Britain in Southern India , were seeking French assistance with a renewed outbreak of hostilities . The resources planned for the operation against Manila were therefore retained in India and the operation cancelled , but the protection of the China Fleet was still essential and <unk> diverted some of his squadron eastwards to China . 
"
" A number of merchant ships had gathered at Bombay in the spring of 1797 in preparation for the trip to <unk> to load trade goods and join the China Fleet . To escort this force , <unk> provided the 40 @-@ gun frigate HMS <unk> , captured from the French at the Battle of <unk> in 1794 , and the 50 @-@ gun HMS Centurion , which sailed with the convoy in July , taking passage through the Straits of <unk> , joined there by the ships of the line HMS <unk> and HMS <unk> and the 32 @-@ gun frigate HMS Fox under Captain Pulteney Malcolm for the final voyage to <unk> . The convoy arrived without incident on 13 December 1797 , although the crews had been substantially weakened by tropical illnesses .

" With his convoy safely at anchor in <unk> and the China Fleet several weeks from sailing , Cooke decided to reconnoitre Manila and make observations on the port and the Spanish squadron based there .

" Leaving the heavier warships at <unk> , Cooke sailed on 5 January 1798 only with <unk> and Fox , the latter carrying a Mr. Bernard , an experienced linguist .

The Spanish squadron had suffered badly in a typhoon in April 1797 and much of the damage had still not been repaired by the time Cooke 's small squadron arrived off Manila .

To Cooke 's disappointment he could also see the Manila galleon , <unk> being <unk> at the <unk> docks and another valuable merchant ship Rey Carlos aground in the harbour .

" Fox was the first British ship into the anchorage , and was consequently approached by the <unk> , whose crew came aboard . Malcolm , like Cooke , spoke French <unk> and with Bernard translating was able to persuade the officer in charge that the new <unk> were Forte and <unk> seeking supplies and Spanish reinforcements for commerce raiding operations . The officer offered supplies but cautioned that none of the Spanish ships would be in a position to sail until March at the earliest . Cooke then joined the party on the deck of Fox , claiming to be Commodore <unk> , a French officer who , unknown to the Spanish , had been killed in the Action of 9 September 1796 off Sumatra .

" The harbour captain reached Fox shortly afterwards , furious at the seizure of the gunboats and demanding they be returned . Malcolm received him with a <unk> of near incomprehensible French and brought him to join the other captured officers in his cabin , while the boat 's crew were imprisoned below decks . Shortly afterwards , at 16 : 00 , Cooke and Malcolm hosted a large dinner for their officer captives and sent food and <unk> to the crew , the total number of Spanish sailors on Fox now numbering approximately 200 . Once the meal was finished , Cooke allowed all of the captives to return to their boats and row for shore without the conditions of parole , although he retained the captured gunboats .

During this time , the Australians sent a number of patrols out in front of their forward elements , one of which managed to slip through the Japanese defensive positions either side of the <unk> Road and carried out a reconnaissance of the <unk> River about 1 @,@ 000 yd ( 910 m ) south of the main crossing . Further patrols were carried out , as well as a number of ambushes , before the advance was resumed on 26 April .

" <unk> their advance , the Australians were supported by three squadrons of <unk> from the Royal New Zealand Air Force — Nos. 14 , 22 and 26 Squadrons — which bombed and <unk> the ground in front of the advancing infantry , as well as a <unk> barrage of artillery and mortar fire . With such strong support the Japanese offered little resistance and over the course of two days the 24th Infantry Battalion covered almost a third of the distance to the <unk> , for just one man wounded . Further progress was made over the next week , but on 4 May the advance was slowed when they encountered a roadblock defended by a field gun along with a machine gun , mines and other improvised explosive devices . After this , the 15th Brigade 's engineer support were called upon to regularly carry out route clearance and proving operations as the Japanese became increasingly desperate to destroy the Australian armour , to the extent that they were prepared to sacrifice an artillery piece in order to lure the Australian tanks into a trap where they could be destroyed by mines . The Japanese began to adapt their tactics in other ways also . To <unk> the effectiveness of the Australian tanks , the Japanese began to position themselves off the roads , forcing the infantry to fight without their armoured support . Additionally , the Japanese began to concentrate their artillery with increasing accuracy upon the advancing infantry , which they kept under constant observation and fire . 
"
" Meanwhile , the previous day , 3 May , the 57th / 60th Infantry Battalion had begun operating along the parallel Commando Road to the north . Here they had a number of encounters and suffered casualties due to their inexperience in patrolling , which resulted in them being ambushed . They also kept up a steady advance and eventually beat the main force in reaching , and crossing the river , arriving there on 6 May . On 5 May , along the <unk> Road , the 24th Infantry Battalion had pressed forward again . <unk> with a tank troop in support , they came up against a concealed field gun defended by approximately 100 Japanese . After the lead Matilda 's machine gun jammed , the field gun opened fire on it , damaging it and wounding its crew . Moving around the stricken tank , the second Matilda , armed with a howitzer , opened fire and destroyed the field gun before sweeping the Japanese defenders from the position . That night , the Japanese artillery opened up on the Australian position with a heavy barrage , and the following morning put in a company @-@ sized counter @-@ attack . The fighting lasted for over two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half hours , but when it was over the Australians remained in possession of the position having repulsed the attack . In doing so , they suffered one killed and nine wounded , while the attacking Japanese had suffered heavily , losing 58 men killed . It was the biggest loss since the action at <unk> 's Knoll and it spelt the end of their attempt to defend the <unk> . 
"
" After this , the Australians were able to resume their advance to the river on 7 May without further opposition . The previous three weeks in which they had advanced 7 @,@ 000 yd ( 6 @,@ 400 m ) to the <unk> had been costly for them , however , with the Australian 24th Infantry Battalion losing 25 killed and 95 wounded . Against this , the Japanese had lost at least 169 killed .

This allowed <unk> to re @-@ evaluate the situation and to issue new orders for the advance towards the <unk> and <unk> Rivers . As they waited for the advance to resume , the Australians carried out reconnaissance patrols deep into Japanese held territory and there were a couple of significant engagements during this time . As a part of these , the 24th Infantry Battalion sent a company across the <unk> and subsequently located a strong Japanese position on a feature that became known as <unk> 's Ridge , which , due to its location , commanded the main Australian axis of advance . 
"
" The main crossing was planned for 20 May , with the <unk> / 59th Infantry Battalion on the right tasked to cut the <unk> Road and the <unk> Track to the east of the river , while on the left the 57th / 60th Infantry Battalion would divert the attention of the Japanese off the 24th Infantry Battalion which would make the main frontal assault from the centre of the Australian line , crossing at the <unk> <unk> , advancing straight up the <unk> Road . Preliminary moves began before this , and on 15 May a platoon from the 24th Infantry Battalion along with two tanks attempted to carry out an attack on <unk> 's Ridge . After one of the tanks was held up and knocked out by a Japanese field gun , they were forced to withdraw . Meanwhile , the <unk> <unk> squadrons — now reinforced by No. 16 Squadron — began an eight @-@ day aerial campaign , attacking along the length of the <unk> and Commando Roads . During this period , the New Zealanders flew 381 sorties , while artillery and mortars fired "" thousands of rounds "" . 
"
" Two days later , on 17 May , the 57th / 60th Infantry Battalion began its diversionary move on the left flank , crossing the <unk> inland and advancing along the Commando Road with 32 <unk> and two batteries of artillery in support . Crossing 500 yd ( 460 m ) north of the <unk> , the centre company carried out an attack along the far bank of the river without its armoured support which had been unable to negotiate the crossing . Nevertheless , shortly before noon they had secured the crossing and began to fan out , carrying out further flanking moves before establishing a firm base to receive supplies and from where it began patrolling operations on 20 May . 
"
" In the centre , the main attack along the <unk> Road began at 08 : 30 on 20 May after 20 minutes of <unk> by New Zealand <unk> had prepared the ground . <unk> under a <unk> barrage , and with mortar and machine gun support , the 24th Infantry Battalion moved forward with three companies up front and one held back in reserve , along with two troops of Matilda tanks . <unk> the forward companies reached their objectives , but one of the companies was halted just short of their objective and was forced to dig @-@ in overnight after coming under heavy small arms and artillery fire and losing four killed and five wounded . The attack was resumed the following day , and the Australians were able to advance to the <unk> <unk> ; however , they were prevented from moving any further as the Japanese were still concentrated in large numbers further to the west where an Australian patrol encountered 70 Japanese and were forced to go to ground . Finally , a company from the 24th Infantry Battalion was able to move on to the high ground on <unk> 's Ridge , which they found to be heavily mined and booby trapped . Engineers and assault pioneers were called up to clear the feature . 
"
" On the right flank , the <unk> / 59th Infantry Battalion carried out a wide flanking move along a track that had been carved out of the west bank of the <unk> by <unk> . Beginning their move two days earlier , a number of patrols had had contacts with the Japanese . Meanwhile , using <unk> to drag the tanks through the mud , the Australian armour had crossed the river also and by 16 : 00 on 20 May the battalion had managed to establish itself in an assembly area to the east of the river , <unk> to the Japanese . The following day , the battalion left the line of departure and began to advance on its primary objective , which it reached in the early afternoon despite being held up while the tanks attempted to affect a creek crossing , and further delayed by stiff resistance . Later , after one of the battalion 's patrols came under heavy fire , the tanks moved up and attacked a Japanese gun position which the defenders quickly abandoned , leaving behind a 70 mm gun and a large amount of ammunition . 
"
" By 22 May , although there were still a number of Japanese in the area which continued to harass and ambush their line of communications , most of the Australian objectives had been secured and <unk> up operations began . The last remaining defensive location before the <unk> was <unk> 's Ridge , where the Japanese were sheltering in tunnels . A heavy aerial and artillery bombardment devastated the position and forced them to abandon the ridge . It was subsequently occupied by a company of Australian infantry . Within a short period of time the <unk> Road was subsequently opened , providing the Australians with the means with which to bring up supplies for the next stage of the campaign , being the advance to the <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> Rivers . The final phase of the battle cost the Japanese 106 killed , while the Australians lost 13 killed and 64 wounded .

" During the course of the fighting around the <unk> , the Australians lost 38 men killed and 159 wounded , while the Japanese lost at least 275 men killed . Following the battle , the Australians continued their advance towards <unk> at the southern end of the island . Throughout the remainder of the month and into June , the 15th Brigade advanced along the <unk> Road , crossing the <unk> on 10 June . Beyond the river , the Japanese resolved to hold the food growing areas in order to protect their precarious food supply , and they consequently occupied a series of deep <unk> . These were steadily reduced with airstrikes and artillery , and the 15th Brigade subsequently crossed <unk> River before being relieved by Brigadier Noel Simpson 's 29th Brigade in early July . 
"
" As the 29th Brigade advanced toward the <unk> River , torrential rain and flooding ultimately brought the advance to a halt . The height of the river rose 2 metres ( 6 @.@ 6 ft ) . The <unk> Road was reduced , in the words of Gavin Long , "" to a sea of mud "" and many of the bridges upon which the Australian supply system was dependent were washed away . This rendered large @-@ scale offensive infantry operations impossible and as the situation worsened for a period of time the Australians even ceased patrolling operations across the <unk> ; meanwhile , the Japanese continued to harass the Australians , probing their positions and setting mines and traps , targeting the Australian line of communications . On 9 July , the 15th Infantry Battalion fought off a series of attacks around <unk> , at the junction of the <unk> River and the <unk> Road , which included a heavy Japanese artillery bombardment . Australian patrols were resumed in late July and continued into August . These attacks proved very costly , particularly amongst the Australian engineers that were tasked with rebuilding the bridges and roads that had been destroyed in the flooding . 
"
" Fighting in the northern sector continued during this time also , and although preparations in the south for the final advance towards <unk> continued into August , combat operations on the island ceased as the war came to an end before these were completed . As a result , the final Australian operations on <unk> took place on the <unk> front in the northern sector , where the Australians had been conducting a holding action since the failed landing at <unk> <unk> had forced them to abandon plans for an advance into the <unk> Peninsula . By mid @-@ August , however , following the dropping of two atomic bombs on <unk> and <unk> and Japan 's subsequent unconditional surrender , a cease fire was ordered on the island and although there were minor clashes following this , it spelt an end to major combat operations .

The game features an anthropomorphic <unk> named Sonic in a quest to defeat Dr. <unk> , a scientist who has imprisoned animals in robots and stolen the magical Chaos <unk> . Sonic the Hedgehog 's gameplay involves collecting rings as a form of health and a simple control scheme , with jumping and attacking controlled by a single button .

" The game 's development began in 1990 , when Sega ordered its <unk> development team to create a game featuring a mascot for the company . After considering a number of suggestions , the developers decided on a blue <unk> with spikes along his head and spine and renamed themselves "" Sonic Team "" to match their character . Sonic the Hedgehog , designed for fast gameplay , was influenced by the games of Super Mario series creator , Shigeru Miyamoto . Sonic the Hedgehog uses a novel technique that allows Sonic 's sprite to roll along curved scenery , which originated in a tech demo created by the game 's programmer , <unk> <unk> .

" The game is divided into six zones ( Green Hill , <unk> , Spring Yard , Labyrinth , Star Light , and <unk> Brain ) , each with its own visual style and enemies . A player must navigate through each zone ( subdivided into three acts ) to progress .
